### Task 0: Simple Rectangle

📝 **Description:** In this task, you are required to define an empty class named `Rectangle` that represents a rectangle. This class should have no attributes or methods.

### Task 1: Real Definition of a Rectangle

📝 **Description:** In this task, you need to define a class `Rectangle` with private instance attributes `width` and `height`. You should provide getter and setter methods for these attributes, and the class should handle exceptions for invalid values.

### Task 2: Area and Perimeter

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will continue working on the `Rectangle` class by adding methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle. You should handle cases where either the width or height is zero.

### Task 3: String Representation

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will enhance the `Rectangle` class by adding a method to create a string representation of the rectangle using `#` characters. Additionally, you should override the `print()` and `str()` functions to display the rectangle.

### Task 4: Eval is Magic

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will modify the `Rectangle` class to include a method that allows the object to be recreated using the `eval()` function. This will involve implementing a custom `repr()` method.

### Task 5: Detect Instance Deletion

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will modify the `Rectangle` class to print a message when an instance of the class is deleted using the `del` keyword. You will implement a `__del__` method for this purpose.

### Task 6: How Many Instances

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will add a class attribute `number_of_instances` to the `Rectangle` class. This attribute will keep track of the number of `Rectangle` objects created and deleted. It will be incremented on instantiation and decremented on deletion.

### Task 7: Change Representation

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will modify the `Rectangle` class to include a public class attribute `print_symbol`. This attribute will determine the character used to represent the rectangle when calling `print()` and `str()` methods.

### Task 8: Compare Rectangles

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will add a static method `bigger_or_equal()` to the `Rectangle` class. This method will compare two `Rectangle` objects based on their areas and return the one with the larger area. You'll also handle exceptions for invalid inputs.

### Task 9: A Square is a Rectangle

📝 **Description:** In this task, you will modify the `Rectangle` class to include a class method `square()` that creates a new `Rectangle` instance where both width and height are equal (creating a square).

### Task 10: N Queens (Advanced)

📝 **Description:** In this advanced task, you will implement a program to solve the N queens puzzle. The program will take an integer N as input and print all possible solutions to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard.

Remember to follow the specific requirements and error handling for each task as outlined in the prompt. Good luck! 🚀
