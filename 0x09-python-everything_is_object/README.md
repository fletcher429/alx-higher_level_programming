🐍📚 **Python - Everything is an Object** 📚🐍

---

🎉 Welcome to the fascinating world of Python programming! 🎉

In this project, we delve into the fundamental concept that makes Python truly exceptional: everything is an object! From integers to lists, functions to classes, Python treats everything as objects, offering a unified model that simplifies programming and fosters flexibility.

🔍 **Background Context:**

Have you ever encountered unexpected behavior when dealing with variables? Fear not! We explore scenarios where assignments and references play pivotal roles. Through engaging questions and thoughtful discussions, we unravel Python's uniqueness and its approach to handling different types of objects.

🤔 **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this project, you'll effortlessly explain Python's awesomeness and key concepts like:
- Understanding objects and their values
- Differentiating between mutable and immutable objects
- Grasping the essence of references, aliases, and assignments
- Identifying identical variables and object linkage
- Recognizing mutable and immutable built-in types
- Unveiling Python's method of passing variables to functions

📘 **Resources:**

Dive into Python's documentation and enrich your understanding:
- Explore the distinction between immutable and mutable types
- Master the art of cloning lists
- Delve into the intricacies of tuples - immutable yet potentially changing
- Discover Python's approach to mutation

🛠️ **Requirements:**

In this project, you'll create Python scripts using your favorite editors - whether it's vi, vim, or emacs. Remember to adhere to the guidelines:
- Scripts should be executable and end with a newline character
- Embrace the power of pycodestyle for clean and readable code
- Craft a comprehensive README.md to guide fellow learners through the project
