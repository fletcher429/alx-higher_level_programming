# Python Input/Output Project

üéâ We're moving to Discord! In a few days, we will be leaving Slack in favor of Discord. üéâ

This Python project covers various aspects of input and output operations in Python. It includes tasks related to reading and writing files, working with JSON data, and creating a Pascal's Triangle.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Read File
- Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.

### 1. Write to a File
- Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.

### 2. Append to a File
- Write a function that appends a string to the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.

### 3. To JSON String
- Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

### 4. From JSON String to Object
- Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.

### 5. Save Object to a File
- Write a function that writes an object to a text file using JSON representation.

### 6. Create Object from a JSON File
- Write a function that creates an object from a JSON file.

### 7. Load, Add, Save
- Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file using JSON representation.

### 8. Class to JSON
- Write a function that returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.

### 9. Student to JSON
- Create a Student class with attributes and a method to return a JSON representation.

### 10. Student to JSON with Filter
- Enhance the Student class to allow filtering attributes for JSON representation.

### 11. Student to Disk and Reload
- Extend the Student class to support saving and reloading from a JSON file.

### 12. Pascal's Triangle
- Create a function that generates Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists.
