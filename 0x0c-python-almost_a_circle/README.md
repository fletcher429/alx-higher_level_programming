# 🌟 Almost a Circle - Python Object-Oriented Programming Project 🌟

This README provides an overview of the tasks in the "Almost a Circle" project. The project involves the creation of two main classes: `Rectangle` and `Square`, and includes various tasks related to testing, class attributes, methods, and serialization.

## 📌 Task 1: If it's not tested, it doesn't work

**Objective:** Implement unit tests for the classes.

**Description:** In this task, you'll create unit tests for the classes `Rectangle` and `Square`. The tests should cover various class methods and functionalities.

## 📌 Task 2: Base class

**Objective:** Create a base class called `Base`.

**Description:** You'll create a base class called `Base`. This class will be the base for the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes.

## 📌 Task 3: Validate attributes

**Objective:** Add validation for class attributes.

**Description:** Implement validation for attributes in the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes. You need to ensure that the attributes meet specific criteria.

## 📌 Task 4: Area first

**Objective:** Add the `area` method.

**Description:** Create an `area` method within the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes. This method should calculate and return the area of the corresponding shape.

## 📌 Task 5: Display #0

**Objective:** Add the `display` method.

**Description:** Implement the `display` method in the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes. This method should print the shape using `#` characters.

## 📌 Task 6: \_\_str\_\_

**Objective:** Override the `__str__` method.

**Description:** Override the `__str__` method in the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes to return a string representation of the object.

## 📌 Task 7: Display #1

**Objective:** Modify the `display` method.

**Description:** Improve the `display` method in the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes to account for the `x` and `y` attributes.

## 📌 Task 8: Update #0

**Objective:** Add an `update` method.

**Description:** Create an `update` method in the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes to update the attributes of the objects.

## 📌 Task 9: Update #1

**Objective:** Add the `update` method.

**Description:** Extend the `update` method in the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes to allow keyword arguments.

## 📌 Task 10: And now, the Square!

**Objective:** Create the `Square` class.

**Description:** Define a new class called `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`. This class will have its constructor and attributes.

## 📌 Task 11: Square size

**Objective:** Add the `size` property to the `Square` class.

**Description:** Implement the `size` property in the `Square` class to manage the size attribute.

## 📌 Task 12: Square update

**Objective:** Extend the `update` method for the `Square` class.

**Description:** Update the `update` method in the `Square` class to work with `*args` and `**kwargs`.

## 📌 Task 13: Rectangle instance to dictionary representation

**Objective:** Create a method to convert a `Rectangle` instance to a dictionary.

**Description:** Implement a method in the `Rectangle` class to return a dictionary representation of the instance.

## 📌 Task 14: Square instance to dictionary representation

**Objective:** Create a method to convert a `Square` instance to a dictionary.

**Description:** Add a method in the `Square` class to return a dictionary representation of the instance.

## 📌 Task 15: Dictionary to JSON string

**Objective:** Convert a dictionary to a JSON string.

**Description:** Create a function that converts a Python dictionary to a JSON string.

## 📌 Task 16: JSON string to file

**Objective:** Save a JSON string to a file.

**Description:** Implement a function to save a JSON string to a file.

## 📌 Task 17: JSON string to dictionary

**Objective:** Convert a JSON string to a dictionary.

**Description:** Develop a function that converts a JSON string into a Python dictionary.

## 📌 Task 18: Dictionary to Instance

**Objective:** Create an instance from a dictionary.

**Description:** Add a method that creates an instance of the `Rectangle` or `Square` class from a dictionary representation.

By completing these tasks, you'll gain valuable experience in Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), unit testing, and working with JSON data. 🐍🚀
